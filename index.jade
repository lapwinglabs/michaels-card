    # Happy Birthday Michael!

    I'm not really sure what you want or need these days and I'm a bit tight for cash, so I figured I'd do what I know best and that is to make a website.

    I'd like to share a few pieces of advice that I wish I had known when I was first starting college and I'd also like to share with you some things that have inspired me along the way.

    ## Create your own happiness

    Create your own happiness. Do not rely on other people to make you happy. They will inevitably let you down at one point or another, just as you have let countless people down in your own life.

    Find something that you can do by yourself that is empowering and productive. That way, even at the darkest moments in your life you have something to fall back on. Something you can do that no one can take away from you or stop you from doing.

    For me, that's programming. I have found that the best way to pull myself out of a slump is to build something. It's relaxing and it forces my mind to focus on something else. I can do it anywhere, at any hour, with or without anyone else.

    Mia is empowered by her art. She can do it anywhere, at any hour, with or without anyone else.

    Find something that is productive and feels right. This is my favorite video on the topic.

    ## Seek out and learn from people that inspire you

    Seek out and learn from people that inspire you. And these people don't necessarily have to be people you have met or people that are alive or even people that are real.

    I watch a lot of Youtube when I'm struggling through something. Youtube is amazing because it gives you access to a pool of people that you wouldn't normally have access to. People that are better that are way better at life than you in every imaginable way ;-)

    I watch interviews from the Obama, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Will Smith and many others to try to figure out what makes them tick.

    These are highly personal and yours are bound to be different, but here's a few videos that inspire me in some way or another:

    *John Mayer's devotion:*

    *Will Smith's charisma:*

    *Steve Job's insight:*

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Hd_ptbiPoXM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    *Jony Ive's articulation:*

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mGZvQS1AbBM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    *Aung San Suu Kyi's relentless pursuit:*

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wRYyEk-5zoI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    *Elon Musk's future:*

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/P79E0-3LeW8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    Do not be afraid to emulate someone that inspires you. When you emulate someone, whether it's their charisma or devotion or photoshop skills, you will inevitably fall short, but along the way you will find your own style. Something that works for you and sets you apart.

    Along with emulation, don't be afraid to compliment someone when they are do something right or good. Compliments come few and far between and I bet you remember most of the compliments you recieved in your life. Recieving a sincere compliment from a stranger or a friend is the best remedy for a bad day.

    ## Listen more than you speak

    This is a piece of advice that I learned recently that has been helping me out a lot.

    When you talk, you already know everything that you're going to say. That is to say, you're not learning anything new when you listen to yourself talk. Attention feels good, but it's not enlightening.

    When you listen to someone else talk, you tend to learn something new. It could be mundane or irrelevant but it could also be immensely helpful and insightful.

    The other added benefit is that most people enjoy attention and listening to themselves talk. This is one of the easiest ways to get someone to like you. The most charismatic people I know are the best listeners with the best questions.

    So the next time you're in a conversation with someone, consider the amount of time you've been talking with the amount of time they've been talking. Try to keep the balance in their favor.

    ## Everyone is in the same boat

    The last piece of advice that helped me out a lot while in college and beyond was the realization that we are all in the same boat. None of us know what we're doing and none of us have any great revelations. We all have our demons and we're all just trying to live life in the best way we know how. This fact won't change as you get older. Mom, Dad, Grandma and Grandpa don't know what they're doing either.

    I think this insight helps you open up to others about your vulnerabilities. I think it also levels the playing field a little bit. I bet that cute girl across the hall has her own insecurities that she's battling with. What about that boy with all the answers? I bet he feels inadequate most of the time. Don't be afraid to feel vulnerable – that's one of the best ways to intimately connect with someone else.

    This is the most heart-wrenching essay I've ever read on this topic:

    > We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I could say that’s what I want in life. What I’m grateful and thankful to have found at Yale, and what I’m scared of losing when we wake up tomorrow and leave this place.

    > It’s not quite love and it’s not quite community; it’s just this feeling that there are people, an abundance of people, who are in this together. Who are on your team. When the check is paid and you stay at the table. When it’s four a.m. and no one goes to bed. That night with the guitar. That night we can’t remember. That time we did, we went, we saw, we laughed, we felt. The hats.

    > Yale is full of tiny circles we pull around ourselves. A cappella groups, sports teams, houses, societies, clubs. These tiny groups that make us feel loved and safe and part of something even on our loneliest nights when we stumble home to our computers — partner-less, tired, awake. We won’t have those next year. We won’t live on the same block as all our friends. We won’t have a bunch of group-texts.

    > This scares me. More than finding the right job or city or spouse – I’m scared of losing this web we’re in. This elusive, indefinable, opposite of loneliness. This feeling I feel right now.

    > But let us get one thing straight: the best years of our lives are not behind us. They’re part of us and they are set for repetition as we grow up and move to New York and away from New York and wish we did or didn’t live in New York. I plan on having parties when I’m 30. I plan on having fun when I’m old. Any notion of THE BEST years comes from clichéd “should haves…” “if I’d…” “wish I’d…”

    > Of course, there are things we wished we did: our readings, that boy across the hall. We’re our own hardest critics and it’s easy to let ourselves down. Sleeping too late. Procrastinating. Cutting corners. More than once I’ve looked back on my High School self and thought: how did I do that? How did I work so hard? Our private insecurities follow us and will always follow us.

    > But the thing is, we’re all like that. Nobody wakes up when they want to. Nobody did all of their reading (except maybe the crazy people who win the prizes…) We have these impossibly high standards and we’ll probably never live up to our perfect fantasies of our future selves. But I feel like that’s okay.

    > We’re so young. We’re so young. We’re twenty-two years old. We have so much time. There’s this sentiment I sometimes sense, creeping in our collective conscious as we lay alone after a party, or pack up our books when we give in and go out – that it is somehow too late. That others are somehow ahead. More accomplished, more specialized. More on the path to somehow saving the world, somehow creating or inventing or improving. That it’s too late now to BEGIN a beginning and we must settle for continuance, for commencement.

    > When we came to Yale, there was this sense of possibility. This immense and indefinable potential energy – and it’s easy to feel like that’s slipped away. We never had to choose and suddenly we’ve had to. Some of us have focused ourselves. Some of us know exactly what we want and are on the path to get it; already going to med school, working at the perfect NGO, doing research. To you I say both congratulations and you suck.

    > For most of us, however, we’re somewhat lost in this sea of liberal arts. Not quite sure what road we’re on and whether we should have taken it. If only I had majored in biology…if only I’d gotten involved in journalism as a freshman…if only I’d thought to apply for this or for that…

    > What we have to remember is that we can still do anything. We can change our minds. We can start over. Get a post-bac or try writing for the first time. The notion that it’s too late to do anything is comical. It’s hilarious. We’re graduating college. We’re so young. We can’t, we MUST not lose this sense of possibility because in the end, it’s all we have.

    > In the heart of a winter Friday night my freshman year, I was dazed and confused when I got a call from my friends to meet them at EST. Dazedly and confusedly, I began trudging to SSS, probably the point on campus farthest away. Remarkably, it wasn’t until I arrived at the door that I questioned how and why exactly my friends were partying in Yale’s administrative building. Of course, they weren’t. But it was cold and my ID somehow worked so I went inside SSS to pull out my phone. It was quiet, the old wood creaking and the snow barely visible outside the stained glass. And I sat down. And I looked up. At this giant room I was in. At this place where thousands of people had sat before me. And alone, at night, in the middle of a New Haven storm, I felt so remarkably, unbelievably safe.

    > We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I’d say that’s how I feel at Yale. How I feel right now. Here. With all of you. In love, impressed, humbled, scared. And we don’t have to lose that.

    > We’re in this together, 2012. Let’s make something happen to this world.

    The piece below was written by Marina Keegan ’12 for a special edition of the News distributed at the class of 2012’s commencement exercises last week. Keegan died in a car accident on Saturday. She was 22.

    I didn't include this to scare you or depress you, but to pursue your exactly what you want. College is the first time in your life, you start taking the wheel. It doesn't get any easier, in fact, as you get older you just get more responsibility with less safety net. Nothing in this life is a given and it's a waste of time to pursue anything other than your dreams.

    ## Conclusion

    I hope this letter finds you well. I hope you find at least one or two things here that you can apply to your own life. We are all extremely proud of you. We will always have your back no matter what. Have a great 19th birthday Michael.
